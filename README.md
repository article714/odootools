# A collection of Tools for Odoo

**Requirements**

- Python >= 3.7.0
- (see _requirements.txt_)

**WARNING**: the master git repository for this project is hosted at [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/article714/odootools). 
It its then *mirrored* on [gitbub.com](https://github.com/article714/odootools). 
Thus, you should not push anything to github when working on `odootools`

## Supported Odoo versions

This tooling supports odoo versions > 11.0, i.e. all versions using a 3.x python runtime.

After a massive refactoring, odootools repository no longer uses "version" branches.
The tooling is now the same for all supported Odoo versions.

Older versions, compatible with python 2.7, are still accessible from 10.0 & 11.0 branches but
no longer maintained.
